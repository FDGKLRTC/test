Hello Ladies and gentelmen i am your loyal fellow Host Mehdi Chakroun(accent francais) and todays subject is going to be robots so if you have been living under a rock or in the cabin in the woods cut off from the world,or you are the kind that don't watch the news because you think it s goverment propaganda and a way to get brainwash us and get rid of our freewill (i am totally not judging you)this video is definetly for you.
Robots ,also known as tincans or metal heads or braindead pieces of scrap metal are extremly useful now jokes aside  let me explain:
A robote  is a machine programmed to  capable of executing a series of complex commands ,and the thing is it can be programmed to do anything with a precision and efficency that is literally inyhuman putting any factory worker to rest and the thing is it can do anything from farming crafting cooking the only limitaiton is it s programming so basically we the human mind is the only limitation, but the thing is machins are evoloving day after day learning from their mistakes and adjusting their behaviour accordingly removing the only obstacke that there was in in their way ad it got a lot of advantages like a Robot produces more accurate and high quality work
.Robots rarely makes mistakes and are more precise than human workers
.They can produce a greater quantity in a short amount of time
.They can work at a constant speed with no breaks, days off or holiday time
.They can perform applications with more repeatability than humans.


Machines are the future and the way forward but this future most resachereres ,say is still pretty far way because machine learning is a new domain that emerged in the late 20th century and let s not forget the downsides firstly They Lead Humans To Lose Their Jobs, They Need Constant Power,They Have No Emotions,Theyâ€™re Expensive To Install and maintain but those all are minor or temporary setbacks that will eventually thanks to science be resolved,the age of the machine has just begune and with a guiduing hand and good moral compass they will lead us to a brighter ,safer and ultimately a better future for the next generations
